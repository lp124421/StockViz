More About Black-Scholes Model:
   What it is: A mathematical framework for valuing European call and put options..

   What it does: Estimates a “fair” option price under idealized conditions (with assumption constant volatility, no dividends, continuous trading).

   How it works:

   Calculates two parameters, d₁ and d₂, based on current stock price (S), strike price (K), time to expiration (T), volatility (σ), and risk-free rate (r).

   Uses the cumulative normal distribution, Φ(·), to weight payoff probabilities under a risk-neutral measure.

   Produces closed-form expressions for call and put prices:
